Asteroid Game

Asteroid Game is a simple 2D arcade game developed as part of my journey in learning Python and exploring game development concepts. The project is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids, where the player controls a spaceship and destroys asteroids.

📜 Description

In this game, the player shoots at asteroids that split into smaller fragments upon being hit until they reach a minimum size. The goal is to clear the screen of all asteroids while avoiding collisions.

🔧 Technologies Used

	•	Python — the primary programming language.
	•	Pygame — a library for 2D game development.

🚀 Key Features

	1.	Spaceship controls:
	•	Move forward/backward.
	•	Rotate.
	•	Shoot projectiles.
	2.	Asteroid mechanics:
	•	Random asteroid generation.
	•	Splitting asteroids into smaller fragments when hit.

📂 Installation and Running the Game

	1.	Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version 3.8+).
	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install pygame


	3.	Clone the repository or copy the code.
	4.	Run the game:

python3 main.py


🎮 Controls

	•	W: Accelerate.
	•	A, D: Rotate the spaceship.
	•	Space: Shoot projectiles.

🛠 Learning Goals

This project explores:
	•	Basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
	•	Working with the Pygame library.
	•	Developing animations, handling events, and implementing game logic.

🤝 Acknowledgments

This game was developed as a part of learning Python. A big thank you to boot.dev for their guidance and support!
